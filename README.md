# INSTAGRAM MARKETING LANDSCAPE

This project is mainly focused on improving the marketing of Instagram content.
It contains different sections that project exactly how if the content is well managed can be profitable. Through testimonials and clear maths statistics, you'll get to understand how exactly this maerketing landscape works.

The entire code source is written in different languages:
  - HTML: It was used designing the flow of content on the webpage.
  - CSS: Embedded in a self-created library named Shinobi, I used SASS to create the library where it holds all the css codes and you could simply refer to them ass classes in your HTML code.
      (I WOULD REFER TO THIS AS BOOTSRAP OR TAILWIND CSS)
  - GULP was also used while developing the landscape.

    
    NB: No JavaScript was used while creating this landscape.
